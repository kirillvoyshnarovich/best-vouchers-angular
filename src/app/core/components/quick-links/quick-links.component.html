                        At The Best Vouchers, we understand that sometimes, as a result of an emergency, 
                        something unfortunate may happen that will prevent you from using your coupon. 
                        Therefore, we allow cancellation of the voucher and offer refund of its costs to 
                        your bank account.

                            and the provider of the service to which the voucher relates do not waste time or money. 
                            By cancelling the unused voucher, you are guaranteed that the money will return to your bank account 
                            in just two weeks after accepting the return! This way you can decide to try another voucher
