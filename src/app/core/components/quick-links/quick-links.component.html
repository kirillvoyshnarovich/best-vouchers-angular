                the link provided at the end of a message.
                </li>

                        to the Buyers using the Website. Session cookies are assigned in the Buyer login process and are removed

If the Complaint does not include information necessary for its consideration, the Seller shall request the person submitting the Complaint to provide the necessary information, and the term of 14 days shall then run from the day on which the correctly completed Complaint is received.</li>
                <li>The complaint should include at least the Buyer’s full name, the Buyer’s email address, a description of any objections raised and an indication of the proposed method of resolving the Complaint.</li>
                <li>A response to a Complaint shall be sent to the email address specified by the Buyer in the Order. In justified cases, the Seller may send a response to another email address specified by the person submitting the Complaint which is not assigned to the Order.</li>
                <li>Should it be impossible to identify the User, the complaint will be left unconsidered.</li>
                <li>The Seller shall not be liable for any damage not caused by the Seller’s fault.</li>
                <li>If, in the event when the Access Code or Voucher is redeemed, the Buyer has reservations about the Educational Packages or services purchased with the use of the Voucher, any claims in this respect shall be addressed directly to the Service Provider. This is due to the fact that the Controller/Seller only sells Vouchers and Access Codes and makes the Website available, and it is the Service Provider, not the Controller/Seller responsible for Educational Packages, the use of which is made possible by the Access Code received from the Seller and the services, which the Voucher enables. However, should the Buyer and the Service Provider fail to reach an agreement, the Controller/Seller may, at the request of the Buyer, help to solve the dispute.</li>
                <li>The Controller/Seller may cancel or refuse to issue a specific Access Code or Voucher at any time as a result of errors linked to the issuance or processing of the Access Codes or Vouchers or if the Controller/Seller states that the Buyer has requested the issuance of the Access Code or Voucher or used the Access Code or Voucher incorrectly, in a manner inconsistent with its intended purpose, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, or because the Access Code or Voucher has been falsified or changed.</li>
                <li>The Buyer may submit a complaint on the functioning of the Website to the Website Controller, and if the sale process of Access Codes or Vouchers is operating incorrectly, the Buyer may submit a complaint to the Seller.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3><strong>12. Withdrawal from the Contract</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Buyer who did not use the Voucher or Access Code shall be entitled to withdraw from the Contract within 14 days from its conclusion date and receive the full refund of costs.</li>
                <li>The Buyer who used the Voucher or Access Code loses the right to withdraw from the Contract.</li>
                <li>The Buyer may withdraw from the Contract by sending an email confirming their wish to withdraw from the Contract to: <span style="background: yellow;">warranty@thebestvouchers.com</span></li>
                <li>It is impossible to withdraw from the Access Code or Voucher Sales Contract in relation to an Access Code or Voucher which has already been used. The use of an Access Code or Voucher shall be understood to mean the use by the Buyer of the received Access Code or Voucher enabling the use of the Educational Package, other services offered by Service Providers or the use of the Gift.</li>
            </ol>
